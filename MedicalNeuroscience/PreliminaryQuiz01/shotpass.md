The question is asking which molecules are involved in **encoding information** necessary for building proteins. This refers to the process of **storing, transmitting, or translating genetic information** in a cell to synthesize proteins. Let's examine the given options:

---

### **Relevant to Encoding Information for Proteins**

1. **Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)**:
   
   - **Role**: DNA is the primary molecule that stores genetic information in cells. It contains the instructions (genes) needed to build proteins through transcription and translation.
   - **Correct Answer**: ✅ Yes.

2. **Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)**:
   
   - **Role**: RNA is directly involved in the process of building proteins. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic instructions from DNA to ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized. Other types of RNA, like tRNA and rRNA, also play roles in protein synthesis.
   - **Correct Answer**: ✅ Yes.

---

### **Not Relevant to Encoding Protein Information**

3. **Fatty Acids**:
   
   - **Role**: These are building blocks of lipids and are involved in energy storage and cell membrane structure but have no role in encoding or processing genetic information.
   - **Correct Answer**: ❌ No.

4. **Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP)**:
   
   - **Role**: cGMP is a signaling molecule involved in cellular communication but does not encode genetic information or participate in protein synthesis.
   - **Correct Answer**: ❌ No.

5. **Acetylcholine (ACh)**:
   
   - **Role**: A neurotransmitter involved in communication between nerve cells but unrelated to genetic information or protein building.
   - **Correct Answer**: ❌ No.

6. **Glucose**:
   
   - **Role**: A carbohydrate that provides energy for cells but has no role in storing or transmitting genetic information.
   - **Correct Answer**: ❌ No.

7. **Cholesterol**:
   
   - **Role**: A lipid molecule involved in cell membrane structure and steroid hormone synthesis but does not encode genetic information.
   - **Correct Answer**: ❌ No.

---

### **Correct Answers**:

- **Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)**

**Encoding information** refers to the process of storing, transmitting, or representing data in a specific format that can be understood, interpreted, or used by a system. In the context of biology, it means how genetic information is stored and processed to build and maintain living organisms.

---

### **In Biology (Protein Synthesis Context):**

1. **DNA as the Information Storehouse**:
   
   - DNA contains the genetic "blueprint" that encodes instructions for building proteins.
   - This information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in the DNA molecule.

2. **RNA as the Information Messenger**:
   
   - RNA transcribes this information from DNA and translates it into a form that ribosomes (the cell's protein factories) can read.
   - For example:
     - DNA sequence: **ATG (start codon)**
     - Transcribed RNA sequence: **AUG** (start codon in mRNA)

3. **Translation to Proteins**:
   
   - The encoded information in mRNA is translated into amino acid sequences to build proteins.
   - Each group of three RNA nucleotides (a codon) specifies one amino acid.

---

### **In General Terms:**

Outside biology, **encoding information** could refer to:

- **Digital Communication**: Converting data into binary format (0s and 1s) for computers.
- **Encryption**: Securing data by encoding it into a format only authorized parties can decode.
- **Human Communication**: Using symbols, languages, or codes to convey information (e.g., Morse code).

In all contexts, **encoding** is about turning raw data into a structured form that can be understood or processed by the intended recipient, whether that's a cell, computer, or person.

The most important molecule within a cell that stores energy for metabolic activity is:

**2. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**

---

### **Why ATP is the Correct Answer:**

- **Role in Energy Storage**:  
  ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. It stores energy in the high-energy phosphate bonds and releases it when these bonds are broken (e.g., converting ATP to ADP and Pi).

- **Function in Metabolism**:  
  ATP provides the energy required for nearly all cellular processes, including:
  
  - Muscle contraction
  - Active transport of molecules across membranes
  - Synthesis of macromolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA)

- **Regeneration**:  
  Cells continuously regenerate ATP through processes like glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

---

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **Acetylcholine**:
   
   - A neurotransmitter, not an energy-storing molecule. It transmits signals between nerve cells but doesn’t store or supply energy for metabolism.

2. **Lactic Acid**:
   
   - A byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, not a molecule used to store or supply energy directly.

3. **Calcium**:
   
   - An ion involved in signaling and structural roles (e.g., in bones), not directly related to energy storage.

4. **Cholesterol**:
   
   - A lipid used in cell membrane structure and steroid hormone synthesis, but it does not store energy for immediate use.

5. **Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)**:
   
   - Stores genetic information, not energy for metabolic activities.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The correct answer is **2. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)** because it is the key molecule cells use for storing and providing energy for metabolic processes.

The correct answer is:

**4. Positively charged ions move away from the negative pole.**

---

### **Explanation:**

Charged molecules in an electrical field are influenced by the forces between opposite charges. Here’s what happens:

1. **Positively Charged Ions (Cations):**
   
   - These are attracted to the **negative pole** (cathode) because opposite charges attract.
   - As they are attracted, they move **away from the negative pole** toward the positive pole.

2. **Negatively Charged Ions (Anions):**
   
   - These are attracted to the **positive pole** (anode) and move **away from the negative pole** toward the positive pole.

---

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **Option 1 (Positively charged ions move toward the positive pole):**
   
   - This is incorrect because positively charged ions are repelled by the positive pole, not attracted to it.

2. **Option 2 (Negatively charged ions move away from the positive pole):**
   
   - This is incorrect because negatively charged ions are attracted to the positive pole, not repelled from it.

3. **Option 3 (Negatively charged ions move away from the negative pole):**
   
   - This is incorrect because negatively charged ions are repelled by the negative pole and move toward the positive pole.

4. **Option 5 (Charged molecules aggregate halfway between the two poles):**
   
   - This is incorrect because charged molecules do not stop or aggregate in the middle of an electric field; they continue to move toward their respective oppositely charged poles.

---

### **Summary:**

In an electrical field:

- **Positively charged ions** (cations) move away from the **negative pole** (toward the positive pole).
- **Negatively charged ions** (anions) move away from the **positive pole** (toward the negative pole).

Correct answer: **4.**

The correct answer is:

**3. Capacitor**

---

### **Explanation:**

The **plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells** functions like a **capacitor** in an electrical circuit because it:

1. **Stores Electrical Charge**:
   
   - The plasma membrane separates charges between the inside and outside of the cell.
   - The inside of the cell typically has a negative charge relative to the outside, creating a **membrane potential** (voltage difference).

2. **Lipid Bilayer as an Insulator**:
   
   - The lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane is non-conductive and acts as the insulating layer.
   - This allows the membrane to hold charge on either side, similar to how a capacitor separates and stores charge on its two plates.

3. **Ion Channels as Conductive Pathways**:
   
   - When ion channels open, they allow ions to flow across the membrane, discharging the stored energy much like a capacitor does in an electrical circuit.

---

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **Battery**:
   
   - A battery generates a continuous source of energy through chemical reactions, while the plasma membrane does not create energy but stores charge.

2. **Semiconductor**:
   
   - A semiconductor controls the flow of current in a circuit under certain conditions. The membrane is not analogous to a semiconductor because it doesn’t modulate charge flow based on external voltage.

3. **Alternating Current Source**:
   
   - The plasma membrane does not produce alternating current (AC); it maintains a steady potential difference until disrupted by ion movement.

4. **Insulator**:
   
   - While the lipid bilayer itself is non-conductive, the overall membrane acts as a capacitor, which involves both insulation and charge storage.

---

### **Conclusion**:

The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells functions as a **capacitor**, separating and storing electrical charge to maintain the membrane potential critical for cellular processes like signaling and transport.
